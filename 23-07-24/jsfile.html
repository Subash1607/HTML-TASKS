    <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
    
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level programming language that is used alongside HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive websites. It allows developers to manipulate the content and behavior of web pages in response to user actions.</p>
    
    <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
    
    <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. They are declared using the <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code> keywords and can hold various data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.</p>
    
    <h2>Functions and Control Structures</h2>
    
    <p>Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Control structures such as <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>while</code> statements control the flow of execution based on conditions.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Event Handling</h2>
    
    <p>JavaScript enables event-driven programming where functions (event handlers) are executed in response to user actions like clicks, form submissions, and keyboard inputs. Event listeners are used to attach these functions to specific HTML elements.</p>
    <h2>Versions of JavaScript</h2>
    
    <p>JavaScript has evolved over the years with several versions:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ECMAScript 1 (1997):</strong> The first standardized version of JavaScript.</li>
        <li><strong>ECMAScript 2 and 3 (1998 and 1999):</strong> Added minor features and enhancements.</li>
        <li><strong>ECMAScript 5 (2009):</strong> Introduced new features including strict mode, JSON support, and methods like <code>forEach()</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>ECMAScript 6 (ES6/ES2015):</strong> Released in 2015, brought significant updates like arrow functions, classes, and template literals.</li>
        <li><strong>Subsequent versions:</strong> ECMAScript continues to be updated with new features and improvements, with new versions released yearly.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Modern JavaScript implementations in web browsers and server-side environments support a wide range of ECMAScript features, enabling developers to build complex applications and perform asynchronous programming efficiently.</p>
